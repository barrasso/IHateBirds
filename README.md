I Hate Birds
==========

I Hate Birds is a mobile game built for iOS and Android devices. It is a stress relieving game that tests your swiping stamina, accuracy and hatred for birds.

The birds come in waves, and eventually the waves become increasingly more difficult. However, that means more birds to kill (yay).

You swipe through the birds in order to shoot arrows at them. Don't just kill the birds, get multipliers by shooting them faster, more accurately and getting multi-kills. You can double swipe through birds in order to hit them twice for bonus points!
